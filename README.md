# Unsupervised Manifold Alignment
This repository contains python scripts corresponding to my work towards my M.Sc. Thesis in TU Delft. 
The scripts can be divided into 2 parts - Manifold Projection and Manifold Alignment. 
The folder "Topological_Autoencoder" contains scripts for Manifold Projection and folder "TopoGAN" contains scripts for Manifold Alignment. 
All the processed datasets are available in "Data". 
There is an additional folder, "UnionCom". This contains scripts to run UnionCom on datasets available in "Data". 
The original UnionCom repository can be found at "https://github.com/caokai1073/UnionCom".
